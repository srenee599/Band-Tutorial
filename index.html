              <p><h3>I’m so excited to share this tool with you guys, as it’s something I found this year, and it’s been my saving grace for digital learning and online communication with my peers for group activities.</p>
                <p><h3><a href="https://band.us/home">Band</a> is a neat little platform that takes your group projects a step further by not only allowing you to chat quickly with memebers, but allows you to share a feed to keep one another updated and in-the-know at all times.</h3></p>
                  <p><h3>The first thing to do is to sign up for an account, and prepare for greatness. You can use your phone number, an email, or preexisting social media accounts to sign up.</h3></p>
