            <h1> Hello everyone!</h1>
              <p><h3>I’m so excited to share this tool with you guys, as it’s something I found this year, and it’s been my saving grace for digital learning and online communication with my peers for group activities.</p>
                <p><h3><a href="https://band.us/home">Band</a> is a neat little platform that takes your group projects a step further by not only allowing you to chat quickly with memebers via group messaging, but it also allows you to share a newsfeed to keep one another updated and in-the-know at all times.</h3></p>
                  <p><h3>The first thing to do is to sign up for an account, and prepare yourself for greatness. You can use your phone number, an email, or a preexisting social media account to sign up.</h3></p>

              <p><h3>The next thing you should do is create your band (group)...on Band (the website)! <p>Once you select "Create a Band" on the homepage, you'll have the option to pick the type of Band you want to make, name your Band, and set an image to represent your Band via upload!</p></h3></p>

              <p><h3>After setting up your accounts cosmetics, you can check out your band's newsfeed and add some posts! You can add videos, photos, and polls to interact with your band members, and they can comment, like, and even share their own posts (if permitted by you, of course). <p>Let's try adding a picture first by clicking the little symbol that resembles a photograph.</p></h3></p>

              <p><h3>Posting photos or text doesn't always get the point across. How about posting some videos? <p>You can upload a video from your computer, or you can link a video from Youtube (like shown in the example)! Just click the little "play" button.</p></h3></p>

              <p><h3>One of my favorite features provided by Band is the polling option! Not only is this good for figuring out the favorite movies of your group members, but it also helps with creating a schedule for seamless meet ups. <p>Check it out by clicking the little button that looks like a bar graph! You can ask a single question with the option of the answers of your choosing--and you can even allow your band members to choose more than one!</p></h3></p>

              <p><h3>After making a few posts, you might have realized there’s no one in your band to see them on the newsfeed yet…to make that happen, send out some invites! <p>By going back under your band's logo, you can click the little "Invite" button which gives you the option to copy a link, send an invite code, use a QR code, or go through inviting someone else with a band account to your Band (on Band)!</p></h3></p>
